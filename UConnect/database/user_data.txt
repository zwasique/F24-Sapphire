I produce logos, do basic animation, and make event flyers. I’m proficient with a few different styles: minimalist and pixel art, mainly. The further you go from pixel art, the further out of my realm you get. Still willing to give it a shot, though - looking forward to exchanging messages.”

ODU’s Children’s Learning & Research Center has allowed me to perform my experiment with their students in August as long as everything is finalised by July 30th. I need an artist to help create interactive elements. I was thinking of something like a pop-up book, but I’m definitely open to coming up with other options. I would need the final product to be finished by early to mid July. You would be working with another childhood psychology student to ensure the design worked well with the experiment.”

The application would allow users to filter by dietary restriction and/or allergen before visiting to see what their options are. In addition to viewing the restriction-friendly sections of the menu, the user would also be able to see if the restaurant can accommodate and modify other dishes. I’d like to work with around 4 other people on this, but this number may change depending on individual skillsets/experience level. I’d like to get this app up and running in about 6 months.
